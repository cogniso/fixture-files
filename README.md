Fixture Files
============

A collection of lightweight files of various formats for use in testing and as sample data.

##Why?
We often have to scrabble around looking for files to use when testing uploads or generating sample
data.  This is just an attempt at putting all these files in one place.  

These files are generally small versions - there's no point uploading and processing a 4 minute MP3 for every one of your specs.  

##Contents
Files are grouped into directories that are named according to their mime types.  

* application/pdf
* application/zip
* audio/flac
* audio/mpeg
* audio/x-ms-wma
* image/gif
* image/jpeg
* image/png
* text/plain
* video/mp4
* video/quicktime

*Missing something? Pull request that badboy.

##How to use

* You could clone the whole repo down to a central place on your system.  
* Clone it into a project if you think you'll use most of the files - we put it in `spec/fixtures`
* Just grab the files you want straight off Github

##Credits
These are files that we have accumulated over a long time.  The videos and audio files particularly were created by
other unknown people. Contact me if they're yours.
