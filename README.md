Fixture Files
============

A collection of lightweight files for use in testing and sample data

##Why?
We often have to scrabble around looking for files to use when testing uploads or generating sample
data.  This is just an attempt at putting all these files in one place.  

##How to use

* You could clone the whole repo down to a central place on your system.  
* Clone it into a project if you think you'll use most of the files - we put it in `spec/fixtures`
* Just grab the files you want straight off Github
